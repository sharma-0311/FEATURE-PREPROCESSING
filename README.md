# FEATURE-PREPROCESSING

**CODEALPHA PROJECTS**

**PROJECT_2 :- DATA PREPROCESSING**

This project implements essential data preprocessing techniques to prepare datasets for machine learning tasks. It focuses on handling missing values, detecting and treating outliers, normalizing/scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. These preprocessing steps are crucial for improving model performance and ensuring robust machine learning workflows.

**Features:**

Missing Value Handling: Impute or remove missing values based on the data.
Outlier Detection: Identify and manage outliers using statistical methods.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize data to enhance model training.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
